## What is `TerminalChat`?

TerminalChat is a completely anonymous terminal chat.<br>
TerminalChat uses SSH for its security and offers its anonymity via not saving chat-logs,
ip's.<br>
We offer fully anonymous chatroom service thru our own framework and server, and extremly easy to setup.
It's something like tor chatrooms, but it's thru terminal with few topics
